I built a very simple Chrome extension that checks the web page for "duplicate" emails, and hides them. :point_down:  
  
## Notes  
:sparkles: - If it's heavily used, I can add more functionality later.  
:information_source: - In this case, duplicate means the emails are side-by-side, and sender/subject (as shown in the list of emails) are identical.  
:pencil2: - It modifies the subject to show the total number of duplicates.  
:stopwatch: - It runs the logic every 3 seconds.  
⏹️ - If you need to see/interact with the duplicates, turn off the extension.  
:hammer_and_wrench: - Fixes / new versions take some time to publish due to Google needing to review them. Be patient.  
:telephone_receiver: - If you have issues, reach out to me instead of leaving a bad review :wink: :wink: :wink:
